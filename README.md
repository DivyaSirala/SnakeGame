# SnakeGame
Simple Snake Game using Pygame
This is a simple snake and apple game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat as many apples as possible to increase the score, length, and speed of the snake. The game ends when the snake either eats itself or touches the boundary of the screen.

## Installation

To run this game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system.

1. **Install Python**: If you haven't already, you can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Pygame**: Pygame can be installed using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

    ```

## Basic Skills Used

- **Python**: The game is implemented using the Python programming language.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Object-oriented principles are used to organize the code into classes and objects.
- **Pygame**: Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It is used here for graphics rendering and user input handling.
